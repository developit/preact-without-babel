# :horse: Preact _without_ Babel, ES2015 or JSX

[Preact] doesn't require that you use any sort of build tooling or transpiler.

This repo contains a bare-bones example of how to use [Preact] in _JavaScript of yesterday_.

Examples are included for both "Classful" Components, and stateless pure functional components.
